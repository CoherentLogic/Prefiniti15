Imagine a world where you can shop and pay for goods and services from small businesses next door and around the world using a single username and password and a single shopping cart. At lightning speed.

Imagine a world where your small business can accept orders, service requests, and payments from customers near and far. Where big-business-class sales statistics, product and service reviews, point-of-sale functions, timesheets, scheduling, delivery mapping, records management, company news feeds, inventory management, and project management are available from any computer with Internet access, anywhere in the world. Leveling the field between small business and large. Bringing your small business into the global marketplace. 

Imagine a world where small-business owners and consumers come together with friends and family on a powerful social network. Where photo albums, blogs, private messages, forums, third-party applications, personal news feeds, and file sharing are available free of charge. The best of social networking combined with the best of Internet commerce.

Imagine a world where one username and password travels with you in all the roles you play, from consumer to friend to family member. From employee to business owner. Anywhere in the world.

This is the world of Prefiniti.
